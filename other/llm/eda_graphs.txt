I want to create a series of graphs and tables to gain a better understanding of this dataset.

First write some r code that will create a line graph, where the y-axis is the amount awarded and the x-axis is time. The line shows the amount spend each month


ChatGPT: Certainly! Here's the R code to create a line graph where the y-axis represents the total amount awarded each month and the x-axis represents time.RCopy code# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your dataframe is named 'df'

# Convert 'award_date' to Date format
df$award_date <- as.Date(df$award_date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

# Create a 'year_month' column
df$year_month <- format(df$award_date, "%Y-%m")

# Aggregate the amount by 'year_month'
monthly_spending <- df %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount))

# Convert 'year_month' to a Date object for proper plotting
monthly_spending$year_month_date <- as.Date(paste0(monthly_spending$year_month, "-01"))

# Plot the line graph
ggplot(monthly_spending, aes(x = year_month_date, y = total_amount)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Amount Spent Each Month",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Amount Awarded") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%m", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Explanation:Data Conversion:Convert the award_date column to Date format to ensure proper date handling.Create a new column year_month to represent each month and year.Data Aggregation:Use dplyr to group the data by year_month and calculate the total amount awarded each month.Data Preparation for Plotting:Convert the year_month into a Date object (year_month_date) by appending "-01" to represent the first day of the month.Plotting:Use ggplot2 to create the line graph.Customize the plot with titles and axis labels.Format the x-axis to display month and year, and rotate the x-axis labels for better readability.Note: Replace 'df' with the actual name of your dataframe if it's different.

Human: this graph is not working, here are the specifications of df
── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delimiter: ","
chr  (5): region, contract, buyer, supplier, link
dbl  (1): amount
date (3): award_date, start_date, end_date

date (3): award_date, start_date, end_date
ChatGPT: I'm sorry to hear that the graph isn't working. Let's troubleshoot the issue and provide an updated code that should work with your dataframe specifications.Given Specifications:award_date is already in Date format.The amount column is numeric (dbl).Your dataframe columns are: region, contract, buyer, supplier, amount, award_date, start_date, end_date, link.Possible Issues:Date Conversion: Since award_date is already a Date object, converting it again might cause issues.NA Values: There might be NA values in the amount or award_date columns.Date Handling: Directly using format() might not create a proper date object for plotting.Updated Code:Let's use the lubridate package for easier date handling and ensure there are no NA values in the critical columns.RCopy code# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

# Assuming your dataframe is named 'df'

# Check for NAs in 'amount' and 'award_date'
sum(is.na(df$amount))      # Should be 0
sum(is.na(df$award_date))  # Should be 0

# Ensure 'amount' is numeric
df$amount <- as.numeric(df$amount)

# Create a 'year_month' column using lubridate
df <- df %>%
  mutate(year_month = floor_date(award_date, "month"))

# Aggregate the amount by 'year_month'
monthly_spending <- df %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount, na.rm = TRUE))

# Print the aggregated data to check
print(monthly_spending)

# Plot the line graph

  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%m", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Explanation:Check for NA Values:We use sum(is.na(df$amount)) and sum(is.na(df$award_date)) to ensure there are no missing values in critical columns.Ensure Correct Data Types:Confirm that amount is numeric.Create 'year_month' Column:Using lubridate::floor_date(), we extract the first day of the month from award_date.Aggregate Data:Group the data by year_month and sum the amount.Plotting:Use ggplot2 to create the line graph.The scale_x_date() function formats the x-axis labels to show year and month.Rotate x-axis labels for better readability.Additional Tips:Install Lubridate Package: If you haven't installed the lubridate package, you can do so using:RCopy codeinstall.packages("lubridate")
Inspect the Data:After aggregating, print monthly_spending to ensure it contains the expected values.RCopy codeprint(monthly_spending)
Error Messages:If you encounter any error messages, please share them so I can provide more specific assistance.Sample Output:Assuming your data is similar to the sample you've provided, the monthly_spending dataframe might look like this:yamlCopy code# A tibble: 3 × 2
  year_month total_amount

2 2024-08-01        59958
3 2024-09-01        22785
This indicates the total amount spent in each month.Common Issues and Solutions:Empty Plot: If the plot area is empty, ensure that monthly_spending is not empty and contains the expected data.Incorrect Dates: If the dates on the x-axis are incorrect, double-check the format of award_date and the creation of year_month.Errors with scale_x_date(): If you get errors related to date scales, ensure that year_month is of class Date.Let Me Know:If you continue to face issues, please let me know any error messages or unexpected behaviors you're experiencing, and I'll be happy to help further.

Human: fix the y-axis scale so that is shows real numbers not 7.2e+09
Human: fix the y-axis scale so that is shows real numbers not 7.2e+09
ChatGPT: Certainly! The reason you're seeing scientific notation (e.g., 7.2e+09) on the y-axis is that ggplot2 automatically formats large numbers in scientific notation for readability. However, we can customize the y-axis labels to display the numbers in a standard numeric format with commas for thousands separators.Here's how you can adjust your code:Load the scales package: This package provides functions for formatting numbers in plots.Modify the ggplot code: Use scale_y_continuous() with the labels argument set to format the numbers as desired.Updated Code:RCopy code# Load necessary libraries

Explanation:Load the scales Package:RCopy codelibrary(scales)
The scales package provides the comma function, which formats numbers with commas as thousands separators.Modify scale_y_continuous():RCopy codescale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
This line tells ggplot2 to format the y-axis labels using the comma function, resulting in numbers like 7,200,000,000 instead of 7.2e+09.Alternative Formatting Options:Use number_format():If you prefer to format the numbers without commas but avoid scientific notation:RCopy codescale_y_continuous(labels = number_format(accuracy = 1))
This will display numbers like 7200000000 instead of 7.2e+09.Customize Number of Digits:If you want to control the number of digits after the decimal point:RCopy codescale_y_continuous(labels = number_format(accuracy = 0.1))
Adjust accuracy to the desired level of precision.Final Notes:Ensure Data Integrity:Before plotting, it's a good practice to check your data for any anomalies or unexpected values.You can inspect the monthly_spending dataframe to verify the aggregated amounts:RCopy codeprint(monthly_spending)
Handle Large Amounts:If the amounts are exceedingly large, consider scaling the y-axis to millions or billions for readability:RCopy codescale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0("$", x / 1e6, "M"))
This would display amounts in millions with a dollar sign, e.g., $7,200M.Sample Output:Assuming your aggregated data looks like this:yamlCopy code# A tibble: 3 × 2

Human: that will create a table of the head of df that can be presented in a qmd file
ChatGPT: Certainly! To create a table of the head of your dataframe df that can be presented in a Quarto (.qmd) file, you can use the knitr::kable() function for a simple, formatted table. This function converts data frames into markdown tables, which render nicely in Quarto documents.Here's how you can do it:{r}Copy code# Load the knitr package
library(knitr)

# Display the first few rows of df as a table
kable(head(df), caption = "First Few Rows of the Dataframe `df`")
Explanation:Load the knitr Package:RCopy codelibrary(knitr)

head(df) retrieves the first six rows of your dataframe.The caption argument adds a title to the table.Optional Enhancements:If you want a more advanced table with additional formatting options, you can use the kableExtra package:{r}Copy code# Load necessary packages
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Create a formatted table
kable(head(df), caption = "First Few Rows of the Dataframe `df`", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
Explanation:booktabs = TRUE enhances the table style.kable_styling() allows you to center the table and adjust its width.Using an Interactive Table with DT Package (Optional):If you prefer an interactive table (sortable, searchable), you can use the DT package:{r}Copy code# Load the DT package
library(DT)

# Display the first few rows of df as an interactive table
datatable(head(df), options = list(pageLength = 6), caption = 'First Few Rows of the Dataframe `df`')
Explanation:datatable() creates an interactive table.options = list(pageLength = 6) sets the number of rows displayed per page.The caption argument adds a title to the table.Sample Output:When you render your Quarto document, the kable() function will produce a table like this:regioncontractbuyersupplieramountaward_datestart_dateend_datelinkFederalLicense/Maintenance fees for client software related to Distributed Computing EnvironmentCanadian Centre for Occupational Health and SafetyIPSS Inc399582024-08-212024-08-012024-08-20https://theijf.org/procurement/po00001779_ccohsFederalComputer equipment related to production and operations (P&O) environment - All servers, storage, printers, etc. (includes all related parts and peripherals)Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and SafetyArticulate Global LLC227852024-09-092024-09-092025-09-08https://theijf.org/procurement/po00001766_ccohsFederalLicense/Maintenance fees for client software related to Distributed Computing EnvironmentCanadian Centre for Occupational Health and SafetyColony Labs, dba Scribe126722024-07-252024-08-162025-08-16https://theijf.org/procurement/po00001782_ccohsFederalConference hosting feesCanadian Centre for Occupational Health and SafetySheraton Suites Calgary Eau Claire1000002024-07-112024-07-042025-05-30https://theijf.org/procurement/po00001778_ccohsFederalOther professional services not elsewhere specifiedCanadian Centre for Occupational Health and SafetyROSS & McBRIDE LLP200002024-08-272024-08-072025-03-31https://theijf.org/procurement/po00001788_ccohsFederalSoftware licenses and maintenanceCanadian Centre for Occupational Health and SafetyMicrosoft Canada Inc.1370542024-08-152024-08-152025-08-14https://theijf.org/procurement/po00001785_ccohsImportant Notes:Ensure Packages are Installed:If you haven't already installed the necessary packages, you can do so with:RCopy codeinstall.packages("knitr")

If you want to include all buyers tied at the 10th position, you can adjust the code accordingly.Improving Readability:If buyer names are too long or not fully visible, consider adjusting the plot dimensions or shortening the names.RCopy code# Shorten buyer names if necessary

Explanation:Load Necessary Libraries:dplyr for data manipulation.ggplot2 for plotting.scales for formatting y-axis labels with commas.Ensure Correct Data Types:Convert amount to numeric in case it's not already.Summarize Total Amount Spent by Each Buyer:Use group_by(buyer) to group the data by the buyer column.Use summarise(total_amount = sum(amount, na.rm = TRUE)) to calculate the total amount spent per buyer.Use arrange(desc(total_amount)) to sort the buyers in descending order of total amount spent.Select the Top Ten Buyers:Use slice_head(n = 10) to select the top ten buyers with the highest total amounts.Plot the Bar Chart:Use ggplot() to initialize the plot with top_ten_buyers data.aes(x = reorder(buyer, total_amount), y = total_amount):reorder(buyer, total_amount) reorders the buyers based on the total_amount, so the bars are ordered.geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") creates the bars with the specified color.coord_flip() flips the axes to make the buyer names more readable on the y-axis.labs() sets the plot title and axis labels.scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) formats the y-axis labels with commas for thousands separators.theme_minimal() applies a minimal theme for a clean look.Additional Notes:Adjusting the Bar Colors:You can change the fill argument in geom_bar() to customize the bar colors.For example, use fill = "steelblue" or choose a color palette.Handling Ties:If multiple buyers have the same total amount and tie for the 10th position, slice_head(n = 10) will arbitrarily select the first ten. If you want to include all buyers tied at the 10th position, you can adjust the code accordingly.Improving Readability:If buyer names are too long or not fully visible, consider adjusting the plot dimensions or shortening the names.RCopy code# Shorten buyer names if necessary
top_ten_buyers$buyer <- substr(top_ten_buyers$buyer, 1, 30)  # Limit to 30 characters
Including Amount Labels on Bars (Optional):You can add labels to show the total amounts on the bars.RCopy codeggplot(top_ten_buyers, aes(x = reorder(buyer, total_amount), y = total_amount)) +

  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 4, 1, 1), "lines"))  # Increase right margin for labels
geom_text() adds the total amount labels to each bar.Adjust hjust and plot.margin to ensure the labels fit within the plot area.Sample Output:Assuming your data, the bar chart will display the top 10 buyers on the y-axis and their corresponding total amounts on the x-axis, with bars representing the total amount spent by each buyer.Let Me Know:If you have any questions or need further assistance customizing the chart or handling any issues, please feel free to ask!

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Explanation:Remove coord_flip():By removing coord_flip(), the bars will extend vertically, and the buyers will be on the x-axis.Adjust reorder() Function:Use reorder(buyer, -total_amount) to order the buyers from highest to lowest total amount on the x-axis.The negative sign -total_amount ensures that the buyers with the highest amounts appear first on the left.Rotate X-Axis Labels:Since buyer names can be long, rotating the x-axis labels by 45 degrees improves readability.Use theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) to rotate the labels.Customize Labels and Titles:Use labs() to set the plot title and axis labels.scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) formats the y-axis labels with commas as thousands separators.Additional Enhancements:Adjust Bar Width (Optional):If the bars are too wide or too narrow, you can adjust their width:RCopy codegeom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", width = 0.7)

### **Troubleshooting Tips:**

- **Labels Still Illegible**:

  - If rotating and wrapping don't make the labels legible, consider abbreviating supplier names or using a horizontal bar chart with `coord_flip()`.

- **Using Horizontal Bar Chart (Optional)**:

  - If legibility remains an issue, you might flip the coordinates:
    ```R
    ggplot(top_suppliers, aes(x = reorder(supplier, total_amount), y = total_amount)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
      coord_flip() +
      # ... rest of the code
    ```
    - This places suppliers on the y-axis and can make long names easier to read.

### **Final Notes:**

- **Adjust Plot Dimensions**:

  - Adjusting the plot dimensions can significantly improve label legibility, especially when saving the plot to a file or displaying it in a larger window.

- **Customizing Colors**:

  - Feel free to customize the bar colors to match your presentation or report theme.

- **Data Integrity**:

  - Ensure that the `supplier` and `amount` data in your dataframe are correct and free of errors or unexpected values.

### **Conclusion:**

By following the steps above, you'll create a clear and legible bar chart showing the amount awarded to the top suppliers, with suppliers on the x-axis and the amount awarded on the y-axis. Adjust the text wrapping and rotation as needed to ensure that all supplier names are readable.

### **Troubleshooting Tips:**

- **Labels Still Illegible**:

  - If rotating and wrapping don't make the labels legible, consider abbreviating supplier names or using a horizontal bar chart with `coord_flip()`.

- **Using Horizontal Bar Chart (Optional)**:

  - If legibility remains an issue, you might flip the coordinates:
    ```R
    ggplot(top_suppliers, aes(x = reorder(supplier, total_amount), y = total_amount)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
      coord_flip() +
      # ... rest of the code
    ```
    - This places suppliers on the y-axis and can make long names easier to read.

### **Final Notes:**

- **Adjust Plot Dimensions**:

  - Adjusting the plot dimensions can significantly improve label legibility, especially when saving the plot to a file or displaying it in a larger window.

- **Customizing Colors**:

  - Feel free to customize the bar colors to match your presentation or report theme.

- **Data Integrity**:

  - Ensure that the `supplier` and `amount` data in your dataframe are correct and free of errors or unexpected values.

### **Conclusion:**

By following the steps above, you'll create a clear and legible bar chart showing the amount awarded to the top suppliers, with suppliers on the x-axis and the amount awarded on the y-axis. Adjust the text wrapping and rotation as needed to ensure that all supplier names are readable.
