    y = "Total Amount Awarded"
    # Remove the legend title by not specifying 'fill' in labs
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

For this graph I want to be able to change the colours based on the buyer. I also want to be able to rename the suppliers for example from cae to CAE. Also i want to change the x-axis so that it shows number in billions

ChatGPT: Here’s an updated code block that implements your requirements:Adds functionality to customize colors based on the buyer.Renames the suppliers (for instance, changing "cae" to "CAE").Updates the x-axis to display numbers in billions.rCopy code# Ensure necessary libraries are loaded
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Create a custom mapping for supplier renaming
supplier_rename <- c("cae" = "CAE", "supplier2" = "Supplier 2") # Add other mappings as needed

Explanation of Changes:Renaming Suppliers:Created a supplier_rename mapping using mutate to replace specific supplier names with desired values.Display in Billions:Divided total_amount by 10910^9109 to convert it to billions.Adjusted the y-axis label accordingly.Custom Colors for Buyers:Used scale_fill_manual() to assign specific colors to different buyers. Update the values to your preferred colors.Legend Removed:Explicitly removed the legend with theme(legend.position = "none").You can customize the color palette and add more supplier mappings in the supplier_rename list as needed.

Explanation:Filtering for Selected Buyers:filtered_df ensures only the specified buyers (selected_buyers) are included in the plot and legend.Restrict Legend Entries:scale_fill_manual() uses the breaks argument to explicitly restrict the legend to display only the specified buyers.Custom Colors:Only the buyers listed in selected_buyers will appear in the legend, with their corresponding custom colors.This approach ensures the legend remains focused on the buyers you choose, while still displaying the complete dataset in the chart (if desired).

Key Adjustments:Include All Data:The aggregated_df is passed directly to ggplot() without filtering, so all buyers are included in the plot.Limit Legend Entries:The breaks argument in scale_fill_manual() ensures only the buyers in selected_buyers appear in the legend.Assign Colors to All Buyers:Buyers not included in selected_buyers will not appear in the legend but will still have a default color in the chart (e.g., "gray" or another color).Descending Order:The bars are ordered by -total_amount to display suppliers from highest to lowest.This setup displays all data in the plot but keeps the legend concise by including only the specified buyers.

Human: now fix the order so that the largest amount (of all buyers for each suppier) is at the top and it goes down

ChatGPT: To order the suppliers by the total aggregated amount (across all buyers) so that the supplier with the largest total is at the top, you need to compute the aggregated total for each supplier and use it to reorder the bars in the plot.

Explanation of Changes:Aggregate Total for Each Supplier:Grouped by word (supplier) to calculate the total total_amount across all buyers for each supplier.Reorder Suppliers by Aggregated Total:Used reorder(word, -total_amount) within the aes() function to ensure the suppliers are ordered in descending order of their total aggregated amounts.All Buyers Included:No filtering is applied to the data, so all buyers are included in the plot.Legend Restriction:The scale_fill_manual() ensures only specified buyers are included in the legend.This approach guarantees the suppliers are displayed from the highest to the lowest total amount (aggregated across buyers) while retaining all data in the plot.
