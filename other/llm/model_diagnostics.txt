Human: model <- lm(amount ~ award_date_numeric + duration_days, data = df)

mil_model <- lm(amount ~ award_date_numeric + duration_days, data = df %>% filter(buyer == "National Defence"))

i have these two linear models in r, what are some diagnostics and validations that i can do on these models? What is the r code that will execute these diagnostics and validations

ChatGPT: When working with linear regression models in R, it's essential to perform diagnostics and validations to ensure that your models meet the underlying assumptions and to assess their reliability and performance. Below are several key diagnostics and validation steps you can perform on your model and mil_model, along with the corresponding R code.1. Model SummaryStart by examining the basic statistics of your models, including coefficients, R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and p-values.rCopy code# Summary of the full model
summary(model)

# Summary of the National Defence model
summary(mil_model)
2. Residual Diagnosticsa. Residuals vs Fitted ValuesThis plot helps check for non-linearity, unequal error variances (heteroscedasticity), and outliers.rCopy code# Residuals vs Fitted for full model
plot(model, which = 1)

# Residuals vs Fitted for National Defence model
plot(mil_model, which = 1)
b. Normal Q-Q PlotAssess whether the residuals are normally distributed.rCopy code# Q-Q Plot for full model
plot(model, which = 2)

# Q-Q Plot for National Defence model
plot(mil_model, which = 2)
c. Scale-Location PlotChecks the homoscedasticity (constant variance) of residuals.rCopy code# Scale-Location Plot for full model
plot(model, which = 3)

# Scale-Location Plot for National Defence model
plot(mil_model, which = 3)
d. Residuals vs LeverageIdentifies influential observations that might unduly affect the model.rCopy code# Residuals vs Leverage for full model
plot(model, which = 5)

# Residuals vs Leverage for National Defence model
plot(mil_model, which = 5)
3. Check for MulticollinearityUse the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity among predictors. VIF values greater than 5 or 10 indicate problematic multicollinearity.rCopy code# Install and load the 'car' package if not already installed
if(!require(car)) install.packages("car")
library(car)

# VIF for full model
vif(model)

# VIF for National Defence model
vif(mil_model)
4. Assessing HomoscedasticityUse the Breusch-Pagan test to statistically test for homoscedasticity.rCopy code# Install and load the 'lmtest' package if not already installed
if(!require(lmtest)) install.packages("lmtest")
library(lmtest)

# Breusch-Pagan test for full model
bptest(model)

# Breusch-Pagan test for National Defence model
bptest(mil_model)
5. Normality of ResidualsPerform the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if residuals are normally distributed.rCopy code# Shapiro-Wilk test for full model residuals
shapiro.test(residuals(model))

# Shapiro-Wilk test for National Defence model residuals
shapiro.test(residuals(mil_model))
6. Influential ObservationsIdentify influential data points using Cook's Distance.rCopy code# Cook's Distance for full model
plot(model, which = 4)

# Identify observations with Cook's Distance > 4/(n - k - 1)
n <- nrow(df)
k <- length(coef(model)) - 1
cooks_threshold <- 4 / (n - k - 1)
influential_full <- which(cooks.distance(model) > cooks_threshold)
influential_full

# Cook's Distance for National Defence model
plot(mil_model, which = 4)

n_mil <- nrow(df %>% filter(buyer == "National Defence"))
k_mil <- length(coef(mil_model)) - 1
cooks_threshold_mil <- 4 / (n_mil - k_mil - 1)
influential_mil <- which(cooks.distance(mil_model) > cooks_threshold_mil)
influential_mil
7. Model Validation Using Cross-ValidationUse k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's predictive performance.rCopy code# Install and load the 'caret' package if not already installed
if(!require(caret)) install.packages("caret")
library(caret)

# Define training control with 10-fold cross-validation
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# Cross-validation for full model
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
cv_model <- train(amount ~ award_date_numeric + duration_days,
                  data = df,
                  method = "lm",
                  trControl = train_control)
print(cv_model)

# Cross-validation for National Defence model
df_mil <- df %>% filter(buyer == "National Defence")
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
cv_mil_model <- train(amount ~ award_date_numeric + duration_days,
                      data = df_mil,
                      method = "lm",
                      trControl = train_control)
print(cv_mil_model)
8. Additional Diagnostic Plots with ggplot2For more customized and publication-ready plots, you can use the ggplot2 package.rCopy code# Install and load required packages
if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Residuals vs Fitted for full model using ggplot2
ggplot(model, aes(.fitted, .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals") +
  ggtitle("Residuals vs Fitted - Full Model")

# Q-Q Plot for full model using ggplot2
ggplot(model, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Normal Q-Q - Full Model")
9. Comparing the Two ModelsAfter performing diagnostics on both models, you might want to compare them to see if filtering by buyer == "National Defence" significantly changes the model's performance or assumptions.rCopy code# Compare R-squared
summary(model)$r.squared
summary(mil_model)$r.squared

# Compare Adjusted R-squared
summary(model)$adj.r.squared
summary(mil_model)$adj.r.squared

# Compare VIF
vif(model)
vif(mil_model)

# Compare AIC
AIC(model, mil_model)
10. Automating Diagnostics with a Custom FunctionTo streamline the diagnostics process for multiple models, you can create a custom function.rCopy codediagnose_model <- function(model, model_name = "Model") {
  cat("### Diagnostics for", model_name, "###\n")
  
  # Summary
  print(summary(model))
  
  # VIF
  if(require(car)) {
    cat("\nVariance Inflation Factors:\n")
    print(vif(model))
  }
  
  # Breusch-Pagan Test
  if(require(lmtest)) {
    cat("\nBreusch-Pagan Test:\n")
    print(bptest(model))
  }
  
  # Shapiro-Wilk Test
  cat("\nShapiro-Wilk Test for Normality of Residuals:\n")
  print(shapiro.test(residuals(model)))
  
  # Cook's Distance
  cooks_d <- cooks.distance(model)
  influential <- which(cooks_d > (4 / (length(model$fitted.values) - length(model$coefficients))))
  cat("\nInfluential Observations (Cook's Distance > threshold):\n")
  print(influential)
  
  # Plot Diagnostics
  par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
  plot(model, main = paste("Diagnostic Plots for", model_name))
  par(mfrow = c(1,1))
}

# Apply the function to both models
diagnose_model(model, "Full Model")
diagnose_model(mil_model, "National Defence Model")
